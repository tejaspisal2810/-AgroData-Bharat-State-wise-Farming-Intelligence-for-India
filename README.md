# 🌾 AgroData Bharat: State-wise Farming Intelligence for India

AgroData Bharat is a data-driven project that provides comprehensive **state-wise agricultural insights** across India. It analyzes crop production, rainfall, fertilizer use, and yield trends while overlaying soil types, cropping calendars, and off-season opportunities. The goal is to assist farmers, researchers, and policymakers with actionable insights — and demonstrate practical applications of data science in agriculture.

🚀 Currently focused on: **Maharashtra**  
📊 Next states in the roadmap: Karnataka, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze long-term trends in crop production, yield, and inputs (rainfall, fertilizer)
- Identify state-specific dominant crops and their suitability with local soils
- Visualize off-season crop potentials and risks using rainfall and soil data
- Develop interactive dashboards for exploring data dynamically
- Publish state-level LinkedIn document posts for outreach and storytelling

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-learn)
- **Streamlit** – for creating interactive dashboards
- **Folium/GeoPandas** – for geographic visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – for analysis and experiments
- **Canva / Google Slides** – for making LinkedIn document posts
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and publishing
